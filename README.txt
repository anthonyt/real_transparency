Anthony Theocharis' "Real Transparency" project aims to provide an intuitive interface for viewing and searching details and statistics about the actions of Canada's Members of Parliament in Ottawa.

It will differ from similar projects [1, 2] in that "Real Transparency" will have a more limited scope (focusing mainly on voting statistics) and provide novel ways to interact with and view the data.

Real Transparency makes use of the new XML data provided by [1].
